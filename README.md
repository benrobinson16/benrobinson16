## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student learning software development for Apple's platforms, the web and the server. I'm proficient in programming languages such as Swift, JavaScript, Python, Go and C# and I've had experience working with many others.

### My Projects

- [**Anxiety Relief: Find Your Calm**](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/anxiety-relief-find-your-calm/id1460568970) is an iOS app I built using Swift and frameworks such as UIKit, SiriKit and more. Recently, I've adopted modern technologies such as WidgetKit and App Clips to further enhance the user experience. The app was inspired by my personal experience with anxiety and was my first to be released to the App Store in September 2019.
- [**Mafia: The Game**](https://mafia-the-game.netlify.com) is a multiplayer game inspired by the classic mafia game played in-person by a group of people. For the server, I deployed a Node.js express API to heroku. The website was built using React and Netlify. For the iOS and tvOS apps, I used Swift (this time using frameworks such as Combine and SwiftUI).
- Many more personal projects such as a CloudKit chore tracker and a quotes manager for set texts.
- More to come in the near future! ðŸ˜‰
