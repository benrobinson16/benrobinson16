## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student learning software development for Apple's platforms, the web and the server.

- Two time Apple Swift Student Challenge winner
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

### Technologies

- **Swift** - My first programming language. I've used this to build iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS apps leveraging frameworks such as *SwiftUI*, *UIKit*, *CoreML*, *Combine* and more.
- **JavaScript** - My preferred language for front-end and (sometimes) also back-end development. Experience using *React*, *Node.js*, *Express* and *ChakraUI*.
- **C#** - Used for school projects and my job.
- **Python** - I've used Python for personal automation and machine learning (including *Tensorflow*).
- **C++** - For competitive programming and the British Informatics Olympiad.

### My Projects

- [**Anxiety Relief: Find Your Calm**](https://anxietyrelief.benrobinson.dev) is an iOS app I built using Swift and frameworks such as UIKit, SiriKit and more. Recently, I've adopted modern technologies such as WidgetKit and App Clips to further enhance the user experience. The app was inspired by my personal experience with anxiety and was my first to be released to the App Store in September 2019.
- [**Mafia: The Game**](https://mafiathegame.benrobinson.dev) is a multiplayer game inspired by the classic mafia game played in-person by a group of people. For the server, I deployed a Node.js express API to heroku. The website was built using React and Netlify. For the iOS and tvOS apps, I used Swift (this time using frameworks such as Combine and SwiftUI).
- [**Where Can I Travel?**](https://wherecanitravel.benrobinson.dev) is a crowd-sourcing platform for global travel restrictions. Find out where you may be able to travel without self-isolation and submit informations about travelling into your country. Build using JavaScript, React and Google Cloud. 
  - 2nd overall in MLH's Hack Around the World. Winner of best domain name.
- [**Run/walk**](https://runwalk.benrobinson.dev) is an independent watchOS app to help runners with interval training.
- Swift packages including [SettingsBundleBuilder](https://github.com/benrobinson16/SettingsBundleBuilder) allowing devs to create iOS settings bundles in a SwiftUI style, and [SplashKit](https://github.com/benrobinson16/SplashKit) which streamlines the process of making Apple-style splash screens.
- [Languages](https://github.com/benrobinson16/languages) is a vocabulary learning platform, built on research in the area of educational psychology. This project consists of a C# server (hosted on AWS), a React.js web app for teachers and an iOS student app. Features push notifications, OAuth with work/school Microsoft accounts and more.
- More to come in the near future! ðŸ˜‰
