## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student learning software development for Apple's platforms, the web and the server.

- WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge winner
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

### Technologies

- **Swift** - My first programming language. I've used this to build iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS apps.
  - **SwiftUI** - My preferred UI framework for Apple's platforms.
- **JavaScript** - My preferred language for the web.
  - **React** - Frontend framework for my website projects. Learning its use on mobile (React Native) and for dynamic websites (Next.js).
  - **Node.js** - Currently the environment I use for REST APIs (with Express.js).
- **C#** - Used for school projects.
- **Python** - I've used Python for personal automation and machine learning (e.g. Minimax, NLP, Turicreate and more).

### My Projects

- [**Anxiety Relief: Find Your Calm**](https://anxietyrelief.benrobinson.dev) is an iOS app I built using Swift and frameworks such as UIKit, SiriKit and more. Recently, I've adopted modern technologies such as WidgetKit and App Clips to further enhance the user experience. The app was inspired by my personal experience with anxiety and was my first to be released to the App Store in September 2019.
- [**Mafia: The Game**](https://mafiathegame.benrobinson.dev) is a multiplayer game inspired by the classic mafia game played in-person by a group of people. For the server, I deployed a Node.js express API to heroku. The website was built using React and Netlify. For the iOS and tvOS apps, I used Swift (this time using frameworks such as Combine and SwiftUI).
- More to come in the near future! ðŸ˜‰
